This file should be placed inside the hardware folder of the Arduino Program, so that the Arduino program will recognize the Stalker board

(It should be situated in users/ "your username" /Arduino/Contents/Resources/Java/hardware/arduino)
 
I recommend adding the section about the Seeduino Stalker to your file.
